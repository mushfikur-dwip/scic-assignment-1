# Security Checklist

## âœ… Completed Security Measures

### Environment Variables
- [x] Created `.env` file for sensitive configuration
- [x] Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent version control exposure
- [x] Created `.env.example` as a template for other developers
- [x] Updated Firebase configuration to use environment variables
- [x] Prefixed all environment variables with `VITE_` for Vite compatibility

### Firebase Security
- [x] Moved Firebase API keys and configuration to environment variables
- [x] Removed hardcoded credentials from source code

## ðŸ”„ Additional Security Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
- [ ] Set up Firebase security rules for Firestore
- [ ] Enable Firebase App Check for additional security
- [ ] Configure CORS settings appropriately
- [ ] Use Firebase hosting security headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts for suspicious activity

### Code Security
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- [ ] Regular dependency updates and security audits

### Authentication Security
- [ ] Implement strong password policies
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication support
- [ ] Set up session timeout and refresh tokens
- [ ] Monitor and log authentication events

## Environment Variables Used

The following environment variables are required:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=         # Firebase project API key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=     # Firebase authentication domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=      # Firebase project ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=  # Firebase storage bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=  # Firebase messaging sender ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=          # Firebase application ID
```

## Notes

- Environment variables with `VITE_` prefix are exposed to the client-side code
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Use different Firebase projects for development and production
